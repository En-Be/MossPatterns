# APPROACH

## Session 02

Minutes: 60 

Todo
- Add colour mode selector
- Add move mode selector

Done
- Tried storing colour values as supplied 'color' datatype, but storage and retrieval as HSB is unreliable, so just using ints again instead
- Hue value cycles 0-360
- Colour has a variation value 
- Movemode selected by chance with likelihood
- Checked if x and y position have decimals, they do
